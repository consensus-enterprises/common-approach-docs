Common Approach Technical Documentation
=======================================

This repository contains technical documentation internal to the Common
Approach Data Standards Tech team, initiated by Consensus Enterprises.

The repository is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site that can be
statically-generated into HTML for publishing. The content is written in
Markdown format, so it's also easily readable under the `content/` directory.

The structure of this documentation follows the
[Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework, so you will find top-level menus for
Tutorials, Howtos, Background, and Reference documentation.
